# Super Collective

Exploring ways to organize Collectives in the Polkadot Ecosystem.
A Collective is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) that is entirely controlled by the blockchain - no centralized managing entity.

Some Polkadot Collectives are considered *essential* for the system - these are called *System Collectives* (SC).  
They may receive an allowance and are held accountable by the general public to fulfil their purpose. 
Each *SC* should be prepared to justify its existence and provide proof of their work in case the general public doubts their efforts.

Super Collective tries to find good approaches to these new issues by providing tools and standards.

## Content

The current focus lays on Work Evidence Reports. These reports are important to prove the delivery of work items to the general public, but also to fellow members. 
With Collectives possibly growing to hundreds (if not thousands) of members, there needs to be a simple way to judge the effort of each member.

- [evidence](https://github.com/super-collective/evidence) contains a structure of how to store and index work reports.
- [collective-cli](https://github.com/super-collective/collective-cli) a CLI to manage work reports. Works best with the aforementioned structure.

## Users

The only collective that is currently using these processes and structures is the [Polkadot Tooling Collective](https://github.com/polkadot-tooling-collective/collective) as a Proof-of-Concept. It will be used to collect feedback and improve user experience. Eventually, other collectives like the Fellowship and the Ambassador Program could rely on this as a successful approach to manage their inner workings.
